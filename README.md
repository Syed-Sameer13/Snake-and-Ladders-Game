A simple **Snakes and Ladders game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project is part of my learning journey as a **II B.Tech student**, exploring **frontend development, JavaScript logic, and DOM manipulation**.

## 🎮 Game Rules

1. The game is played by **two players** taking turns.  
2. Each player starts at **position 0** and needs to roll a **1** to start the game.  
3. On each turn, a player **rolls a dice** (1–6) and moves forward that many positions.  
4. **Snakes** 🐍:  
   - If a player lands on a square with the **head of a snake**, they **slide down** to the snake's tail.  
5. **Ladders** 🪜:  
   - If a player lands at the **bottom of a ladder**, they **climb up** to the top of the ladder.  
6. If a player **overshoots 100**, they **stay in their current position** and wait for the next turn.  
7. The first player to reach **position 100** **wins the game**.  
8. Players can **reset** the game at any time or **quit**, which declares the other player the winner.  

**Tip:** Roll strategically and hope for ladders, but watch out for snakes! 🎲🐍🪜
